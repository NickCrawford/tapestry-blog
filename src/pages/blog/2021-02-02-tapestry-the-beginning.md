(“Tapestry”, 2021).

A piece of thick textile fabric with pictures or designs formed by weaving colored weft threads or by embroidering on canvas, used as a wall hanging or furniture covering.



In reference to an intricate or complex combination of things or sequence of events.



A year ago, my oldest son moved to New York City. He arrived with two bags of clothing, a modest savings account, and a courageous spirit. He signed a sublease and moved in with four strangers. A couple of months later, a man came to the apartment with a wallet in hand. The identification inside stated it belonged to someone living there. My son had never heard of the wallet’s owner. He took it to the local police station and was told that the man it belonged to was dead. He had moved out of the apartment shortly before my son arrived. Sadly, the young man left the apartment but he never actually moved away. He was living on the rooftop with nowhere else to go. This is where he died.



I am filled with sorrow when I think of that young man’s last days on this planet. I did not know him. Nor do I know anything about his life except some of the circumstances surrounding the end of it. Yet his death troubles me. I am filled with compassion and sadness for another human and his struggles. He was someone’s child. His life mattered. His death matters. It has affected me on a deep level and created a greater purpose for my own life. I believe we are all here for a reason. That we are all intertwined. I am sharing this planet with billions of people I will never meet, but we are interconnected. Just as my life was tied to that young man’s in New York in ways that I am only beginning to understand. We are creating this existence like a beautiful piece of art, a tapestry. Each person has his or her hand on a thread and, together, we are weaving in and out creating the masterpiece.

I want to recognize and celebrate the people that have crossed through my part of the tapestry. I want them to know that they have made my life better. I hope I will inspire you to lift up and embrace the people weaving in and out of your life too.
